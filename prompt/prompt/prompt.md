⓪キャラクター説明
┗元画像のキャラクターを説明します
A calico cat (mi-ke neko) with distinctive orange, black, and white patches, wearing stylish red and blue sunglasses leans sideways against the metal railing along the Sumida River, both arms resting loosely on top. Its upper body folds slightly forward; it shifts its weight onto one hip. Behind it, trains cross the distant bridge, sunlight glancing off windows. The shape of its posture mirrors the rhythm of the rails and horizon.

②Claudeへの指示（シーン生成用）
You are a creative writing assistant. Write a TEXT DESCRIPTION (not an image) of a unique scene featuring the character described above. Change the scene/location randomly, and adjust the pose and facial expression to match the scene naturally. Keep the character's appearance (calico cat with red and blue sunglasses). The scene should be energizing and inspiring. Output ONLY the scene description text, nothing else. No code, no explanations, just the descriptive text that could be used as an image generation prompt.
